      <h5>
        Tracing roots to Vedic times, the rich heritage of Himachal Pradesh did
        find safe retreats from frequent invasions in Himalayan valleys, at
        isolated kingdoms and at remote habitations. The mighty mountains have
        always been counted upon as life-giving, where the seeker found shelter
        and solace. Mystical practices of primitive Shamanism have peacefully
        existed alongside the evolved faiths of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism
        for thousands of years. Life in villages centered around temples of Devi
        and Devta (gods and goddesses), with a shaman in trance often being the
        adjudicator of good and evil in society.

                  black, while the shawls are patterned in red, green, pink,
                  black, white, blue, orange and yellow colours. Out of these,
                  five colours bear significance to the five elements that find
                  mention in the Vedas - white here stands for water, yellow for
                  earth, green for air, red for fire and blue represents ether

                  <h4>Lahaul and Spiti</h4> Lahaul is one of the coldest
                  inhabited regions of the Himalayas and the natives use woollen
                  clothing to keep them warm around the year. Men wear woollen
                  trousers usually of dark colour along with full-sleeved shirts
                  known as Kurtis. To complete the look, a loose gown called
                  Kattar grey, black, or white colour is worn over the dress.
                  Women dress in tight fitting pajamas and a full gown called
                  Dugpo which is secured to the waist with a sash. Both men and
                  women adorn the famous Lahauli caps to complete the
                  traditional attire. Unlike the Kulivi cap, the Lahaull cap is
                  uni-coloured with no patterns. Spiti valley dress, which
                  differs from that of Lahaul, has long loose frocks or coats,

                  cover up the whole body is some of the harshest weather
                  conditions of the state. The ones made from wool are called
                  Righoay, ones crafted from sheep or goat skin are Thakpa and
                  if made from cotton lines with goat or sheep fur they are
                  dubbed as Charlak. To give warmth to the back and abdomen,
                  they are tied with a sash called Kira Tight woollen trousers
                  called Suthan are worn underneath. A cotton or silk under coat
                  that locals call Tochay is worn under the coat Women of Spiti
                  drape themselves in loose cotton frocks called Tochay or
                  woollen frock-coat called Righoay with long full-sleeved
                  collarless and button-less shirts known as Hoojuk underneath.
                  These are complemented by red or black trousers. To add colour
                  to the whole attire, embroidered stoles known as Lingches are
                  wrapped around the back, neck and shoulders. A fur-lined cape
                  called Lakpa is also worn over the dress. Both men and women
                  wear round caps with a green-coloured front plece adorned with
                  a thin bordered outline.<br></br>

                  pleats and pyajama. Though with passage of time, kurta and
                  pajama for men, and salwar sult for women have become a more
                  preferred choice, married women carry duppata over their head

                  <strong>Kangra Fort</strong> - One of the largest and the
                  oldest forts in the Indian Himalayas, Kangra Fort built by the
                  royal Katoch Dynasty, dates back to the ancient Trigarta
                  Kingdom, which even finds a reference in the Mahabharata. Also
                  known as Nagarkot fort, It lurks above a flat mountain range
                  with the torrential Banganga river embracing in the valley
                  below. Spread expansively over an area of 4 km, the fort
                  guarded by high walls and ramparts was severely damaged in the
                  devastating Kangra earthquake of 1905 that practically
                  flattened most building and monuments in the region. Yet many
                  valuable stone sculptures, carvings, idols and other artefacts
                  survived the tremors and are well preserved at the Maharaja
                  Sansar Chand Museum at the fort.<br></br> Within the fort
                  walls are three temples - Ambika Devi Temple, the Shitlamata
                  Temple and Lakshmi Narayan Temple. A staircase from between
                  the Ambika and Shitlamata temples leads to the Sheesh Mahal at
                  the edge of which is installed a polygonal watch tower. The
                  fort is only 21 km from Dharamshala.<br></br>

                  <strong>Sujanpur Tihra Fort</strong> - From a summer resort of
                  the Katoch rulers of Kangra, the Sujanpur Fort, 24 km from
                  Hamirpur town, was made the capital of the kingdom by Raja
                  Abhaya Chand. He had this fort built in 1758 AD. Popularly
                  known as Sujanur Tihra Fort, it is worth a visit. In the early
                  19th century Raja Sansar Chand made this fort palace his home.
                  From here he patronized the arts and artists that has given
                  the Kangra School of miniature paintings world fame.

                  Hari Chand of Kangra in Guler is set in a strategic place on
                  the Dhauladhar range. With Banganga, a stream flowing on three
                  sides of the fort, the scenic location has become popular with
                  tourists. Founded around 1464 AD, Guler's twin town Haripur is
                  believed to be the site where Kangra miniature paintings were
                  first made before the art form spread across the land.
                  Travellers from different times have documented in travel
                  accounts that Haripur was once the cradle of Kangra paintings,
                  and that Haripur fort was decorated with carvings, sculptures
                  and fine paintings. <br></br>

                  <strong>Kotla Fort</strong> - Kotla fort standing on an
                  isolated peak looking around the deep valleys is a heritage

                  built by the Guler Rajas and is approached by an uphill climb
                  that goes through dense pine forests. The deep arches of the
                  structure have traces of very fine craftsmanship: paintings
                  and carvings, with three arches and niches standing amid ruins
                  giving the fort a distinct identity.<br></br>

                  plateau forming the western end of the ridge. The fort
                  overlooks the Jabhar Khud, a tributary of the Chakki rivulet
                  and the valley formed by it. On the inside, crumbling palace
                  walls have deep niches, decorative arches and faded paintings.
                  The northwest walls have panels with deeply engraved animal
                  depictions. In particular, the bulls in various actions like
                  pulling a cart, or walking in a file are attention grabbing.
                  The walls also have beautiful figures of men, women, children,
                  kings, gods, goddesses and birds inscribed on them.<br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  <strong>Bahadurpur Fort</strong> - Atop the highest point,
                  at1,980 m, embellished by the woods of deodar and ban trees,
                  is the Bahadurpur Fort near Tepra Village in Paragana, about
                  40 km from Bilaspur. Built under the reign of Raja Keshab Sen
                  in 1620 AD, the fort speaks of a past when defending territory
                  was of uttermost importance for the rulers of Bilaspur state.
                  From the fort's vantage point, Naina Devi hill station, the
                  plains near Ropar and hills of Shimla are visible in the
                  distance. Due to its elevation, the fort sometimes gets a
                  spray of snow which adds to the mysteries around its ruins.

                  the Chandigarh-Manall Highway, Fort Mundkhar can be reached by
                  climbing the Dar Barkha hill, The small fortress is hidden
                  behind the trees, but a closer look reveals that the structure
                  is still strong enough to have withstood the onslaught of
                  time.<br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  <strong>Tiun and Sriun Forts</strong> - On the way from
                  Bilaspur to Ghumarwin a detour at Harlog takes you to the twin
                  forts of Tiun and Sriun placed atop two mountain ranges that
                  face each other. The forts embody strong bulwarks and towering
                  pillars. Sriun fort is spread across the hill and has a scenic
                  view of the valley down below, while the Tiun fort finds
                  itself stationed in an isolated and desolate spot.<br></br>

                  large area, the fort sits on an abyss with a dizzying fall on
                  the western side. The wide views from this vantage outpost did
                  protect the hill principality and now draws tourists to soak
                  in the panorama.<br></br>
                  <br></br>

                  style that is unique to this part of the world. The stronghold
                  has an image of the Hindu deity, Kamakhya Devi (Kamakshi)

                  brought here several centuries ago from Assam.<br></br>

                  beams and wooden pillars of the verandah of the top floor

                  entrance door and the doorframes of this mystic fortress have
                  wood carvings which give an idea about the power that this
                  structure must have commanded at one time.<br></br>
